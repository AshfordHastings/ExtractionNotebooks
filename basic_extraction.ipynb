He was the son of William Biddle, 3rd (1698–1756) and Mary (née Scull) Biddle (1709–1789). His siblings included: Lydia Biddle, who married William Macfunn; John ”Jacky” Biddle, who married Sophia Boone; Edward Biddle, a lawyer, soldier, delegate to the Continental Congress,[1] who married Elizabeth Ross, sister of George Ross; Charles Biddle, and Nicholas Biddle, Revolutionary War Navy captain.[2]\\nAs a youth, Biddle was a schoolmate and close friend of Mathias Aspden and Founding Father Benjamin Rush.[3]\\n\\nCareer[edit]\\nAmerican Revolutionary War[edit]\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Biddle was a captain in the merchant service and participated in the work around of the British fleet\\'s blockade of American ports.  He volunteered in the Quaker Light Infantry and, in 1778, he served under his brother, Commodore Nicholas Biddle, aboard the USS Randolph.[4]\\n\\nPolitical career[edit]\\nBiddle served as Vice President of Pennsylvania, also known as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, from October 10, 1785, until October 31, 1787.[5]  He served under John Dickinson and Benjamin Franklin and hosted George Washington.[6]\\nDuring his term, he was an ex officio trustee of the University of the State of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pennsylvania). He was a member of the Pennsylvania Senate from 1810 to 1814.[7] He also was an associate of Aaron Burr, having introduced Burr to his wife Theodosia shortly after the death of her first husband, Jacques Marcus Prevost.[8]\\nAlthough Biddle vacated his seat at Council on October 13, 1787, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania records that his Vice-Presidential term extended to October 31, the date of the next Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections. Biddle was elected Secretary of the Council on October 23.\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nFurther information: Biddle family\\nAn 1818 portrait of John Biddle, Biddle\\'s son, by Thomas Sully\\nOn November 24, 1778, he was married to Hannah Shepard (d. 1825), the daughter of merchant Jacob Shepard and Sara (née Lewis) Shepard, in Beaufort, North Carolina.[9]  The Biddle family had a summer home outside of Philadelphia that was furnished sumptuously with English furniture and paintings.[8] Together, they were the parents of ten children, including:[10][11]\\n\\nMary Biddle (d. 1854), who married John Gideon Biddle (1793–1826), the fourth son of Clement Biddle, in 1820.[12]\\nNicholas Biddle (b. 1779), who died in infancy.[10]\\nWilliam Shephard Biddle (1781–1835), who married Circe Deroneray. After her death, he married Elizabeth Bordeon Hopkinson, daughter of Joseph Hopkinson.[10]\\nJames Biddle (1783–1848), a commodore with the U.S. Navy who died unmarried.[10]\\nEdward Biddle (1784–1800), a midshipman with the U.S. Navy who died at sea.[10]\\nNicholas Biddle (1786–1844), president of the Second Bank of the United States who married Jane Craig.[10]\\nCharles Biddle Jr. (1787–1836), who married Anna H. Stokes in 1808.[10][4]\\nAnn Biddle (1788-1789)[13]\\nThomas Biddle (1790–1831), a War of 1812 hero who died after a duel with a Missouri Congressman over a perceived insult to his brother Nicholas. He married M. Ann Mulllanphy.[10]\\nJohn Biddle (1792–1859), Michigan politician who married Eliza Falconer Bradish.[10]\\nRichard Biddle (1796–1847), a U.S. Representative who married Ann Anderson.[10]\\nAnn Biddle (1800-1863), who married Francis Hopkinson (1796-1870) in 1829.[13]\\nBiddle died on April 4, 1821, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

       "  \"Marriage and family[edit]\\nWhile in New York City convalescing, Jacques Marc had met Theodosia Stillwell Bartow. They married in Trinity Church in 1763. They had five children together, including Augustine James Frederick Prevost (1765–1842) and John Bartow Prevost (1766–1825).\\nWhile Jacques was away fighting for the British in the West Indies, his wife Theodosia formed a relationship with an American colonel named Aaron Burr, who was ten years younger than her. In 1781, soon after learning of her husband's death, the newly widowed Theodosia got remarried to the young Burr, who adopted the Prevost family's five children. Burr and Theodosia had another five children together, but only their daughter Theodosia Burr Alston survived to adulthood, and was later lost at sea.\",\n",
